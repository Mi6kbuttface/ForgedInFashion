# <ins>[RELEASE!!!] Welcome To ForgedInFashion!</ins>
### [1.0.0] [For LC v50] An expansion pack that adds **80+ Fire Suits**, **350+ Quality Cosmetics**, as well as the <i>(in my expert opinion)</i> **BEST** posters out there! Designed for ***ForgedInFatality***, but can be used for any Modpack!

This expansion pack was designed because there are a lot of trash suits and cosmetic mods in the streets of Thunderstore, but amongst them is straight underrated fire. As your Drip Dealer‚Ñ¢, I would never send you into a fiery death without looking absolutely stiffy. 

DON'T FEEL AFRAID TO GIVE ME FEEDBACK!!! I want to hear all of your thoughts, suggestions, and issues. Feel free to contact me in the [Lethal Company Modding Discord Server](https://discord.com/channels/1168655651455639582/1225622177970257961).
#### **Don't worry, you can use this Modpack addon with ANY Modpack as I've included everything needed for it to be added to other packs, LMK if you'd like to include it in yours!**

- [companyemployee](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/companyemployee/?q=&ordering=most-downloaded&section=mods&nsfw=on&deprecated=on) For having my favorite cosmetics [EquipmentCompany](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/companyemployee/EquipmentCompany/), I love having more vanilla fitting cosmetics for Lethal Company. Quirky meme suits and cosmetics are nice, but vanilla-fitting shit really blends well for style.
- J.e.s.t My poor lab rat that helped me test all of this. Here is some cheese üßÄ.
